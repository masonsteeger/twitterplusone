## Technologies Used
In this application I used PostGreSQL for my database, Express.js and Node.js for my backend and React.js for my frontend. I also used hooks and react-router as some new technologies to help improve the flow of my website a bit. I also used the Bulma framework to help style it and used the react-toastify package for the pop ups notifications.


## Unsolved Problems
Some unsolved problems that I would like to work on in the future are adjusting my code so that the timeline is actually a separate page from the profiles. I would also like to get comments and retweets down and possibly notifications and uploading and displaying a profile picture.
